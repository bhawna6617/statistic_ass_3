    "# Estimation statistics is a branch of statistics that deals with the process of estimating population parameters based on sample data. When you want to make inferences about a population, but you can't collect data from the entire population, you use estimation statistics to make educated guesses about the population parameters.\n",

    "# A point estimate is a single value that is used to approximate the population parameter of interest. It's essentially your best guess at the true value of the parameter based on the sample data.\n",
    "# For example, if you want to estimate the mean height of a population and you take a sample of individuals, the sample mean is a point estimate of the population mean.\n",
    "# Point estimates are often denoted by symbols like \"θ̂\" (theta-hat) or \"μ̂\" (mu-hat) for population means or \"p̂\" (p-hat) for population proportions.\n",
    "# Interval Estimate:\n",
    "\n",
    "# An interval estimate provides a range of values within which the population parameter is likely to fall. It recognizes the uncertainty associated with point estimates and conveys the level of confidence you have in your estimate.\n",
    "# The most common type of interval estimate is the confidence interval. A confidence interval consists of a point estimate and a margin of error, which defines a range around the point estimate.\n",
    "# For example, you might calculate a 95% confidence interval for the population mean height, which could be expressed as (65.2 inches, 68.0 inches). This means you are 95% confident that the true population mean falls within this range.\n",
    "# The confidence level, often expressed as a percentage (e.g., 95%), represents the level of confidence you have in the interval estimate. The larger the confidence level, the wider the interval.\n"

It is a method for evaluating claims or hypotheses about a population parameter to determine whether the available evidence supports or contradicts those claims. Hypothesis testing is widely used in various fields such as science, medicine, economics, and social sciences to draw conclusions and make informed decisions. Here's an overview of hypothesis testing and its importance:\n",

    "# Gather relevant data through observations, experiments, or surveys.\n",
    "# Perform Statistical Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use appropriate statistical methods to analyze the data, such as calculating test statistics or p-values.\n",
    "# Make a Decision:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Based on the analysis, you decide whether to accept the null hypothesis or reject it.\n",
